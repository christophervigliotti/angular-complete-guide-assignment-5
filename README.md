# Assignment 5

This is one of several repos that I created for the course "Angular - The Complete Guide (2022 Edition)". For a complete list of repos created for this course: https://gist.github.com/christophervigliotti/92e5b3b93cbe9d630d8e9d81b7eb6636 .

## Starting Out

* the app toggles users from active to inactive
* the app in it's current/starting form works but needs to be optimised

## Requirements

* add users service to manage users array(s) globally
* add a counters service to count the number of times that a user is toggled, output the results

## Creating The Services

users.service.ts
```
```

counters.service.ts
```
```
